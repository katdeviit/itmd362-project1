        <p>
          Our extended warranty program is designed to be renewed, constantly!
          You will need to receive phone calls regularly, about the renewal of
          your extended warranty.

          We truly believe that our program will be beneficial to your long-term
          well being, as our cars often fail. You will NEED this program.
